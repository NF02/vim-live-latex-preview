# LaTeX Live Preview for NVIM
This plugin allows you to have the live preview in LaTeX for Vim/NeoVim, it is 
simple, it only works on X11, it is perfect for all those who need an efficient
solution and also for all those who are used to Microsoft / LibreOfficie.
Honestly there are no problems the dependencies are as follows:
- zathura;
- xdotool;
- zsh;
- vim.
